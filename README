This is a tool written to help me stay on schedule in my work as a
transcriptionist.  The user provides the length of the audio file, the desired 
pace of transcription, and the ratio of break time to work accomplished.  The 
tool then provides a running clock showing how far into the audio file the 
transcriptionist should be, while keeping track of break time earned and 
spent.  The user can adjust the settings as necessary without resetting the 
clock.

This is obviously targeted at a narrow niche, but I have vague plans to 
refactor and generalize it for other use cases where someone might want to 
maintain a specific, quantifiable pace.  One that comes to mind is NaNoWriMo, 
where people often try to write a particular number of words per session.  If 
I can think of any others, maybe I'll actually do it.
